## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React Native** (0.79.4) with **Expo** (~53.0.12) - Cross-platform mobile development
- **TypeScript** (~5.8.3) - Type-safe development
- **Expo Router** (~5.1.0) - File-based navigation system
- **React Navigation** - Advanced navigation with stack and tab navigators

### Backend & Database
- **Supabase** (^2.50.2) - Backend-as-a-Service with PostgreSQL database
- **AsyncStorage** - Local data persistence
- **Real-time subscriptions** - Live data synchronization

### UI/UX Libraries
- **Expo Linear Gradient** - Beautiful gradient backgrounds
- **React Native Reanimated** - Smooth animations
